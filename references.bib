% BibTeX HOW TO?
% ==============

% We want a clean and concise database! Therefore, we agree on some rules, which
% are listed below.
%
% -------------------
% 1. WHAT TO COLLECT?
% -------------------
%
% We limit our entries to well-defined sets of information. We want only this
% information, nothing more! What we collect depends on the entry type.
%
% For journal articles, we store: author, title, journal, year, volume, number, pages, and doi.
% Nothing more!
%
% Article{Hutchins85DirectManipulation,
%   author  = {Hutchins, Edwin L. and Hollan, James D. and Norman, Donald A.},
%   title   = {{Direct Manipulation Interfaces}},
%   journal = {Human-Computer Interaction},
%   year    = {1985},
%   volume  = {1},
%   number  = {4},
%   pages   = {311--338},
%   doi     = {10.1207/s15327051hci0104_2},
% }
%
% For books, we store: title, publisher, year, author, and if available the edition and doi.
% Optionally, we could store location. Nothing more! 
%
% Book{Tufte01VisualDisplay,
%   title     = {{The Visual Display of Quantitative Information}},
%   publisher = {Graphics Press},
%   year      = {2001},
%   author    = {Edward R. Tufte},
%   edition   = {2},
% }
%
% For papers from proceedings, we store: author, title, booktitle, year, pages, publisher, and doi.
% Nothing more!
% Below, more information is given on the use of string such as PROC and IEEE, which are used w/o { }.
%
% InProceedings{Bader12Helferlein,
%   author    = {Sebastian Bader and Martin Nyolt},
%   title     = {{A Context-aware Publish-subscribe Middleware for Distributed Smart Environments}},
%   booktitle = PROC #{ IEEE Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PERCOM)},
%   year      = {2012},
%   pages     = {100--104},
%   publisher = IEEE,
%   doi       = {10.1109/PerComW.2012.6197458},
% }
%
%
% ----------------------------
% 2. HOW TO STORE INFORMATION?
% ----------------------------
%
% Author names should be fully spelled out, umlauts can be used!
%
% Good: {Hans-Jörg Schulz}
% Bad: {H.-J. Schulz}
%
% Good: {Bruce H. McCormick}
% Bad: {B. H. McCormick}
%
% TITLES should be in double {{ .. }} and properly capitalized!
%
% Good: {{Visualization in Scientific Computing}}
% Bad: {Visualization in Scientific Computing}
%
% Good: {{Direct Manipulation Interfaces}}
% Bad: {{Direct manipulation interfaces}}
%
% JOURNALS and Proceedings should be consistent. We maintain a list of
% strings that should be used wherever possible. String replacements
% are to be used without surrounding { }.
%
% STRINGS are available for several journals: TVCG, CGF, ...
% More can be added on demand.
%
% Good: TVCG
% Bad: {IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics}
%
% Strings for proceedings: InfoVis, AVI, CHI, VIS, VAST, VisSym,
% More can be added.
%
% Good: ITS
% Bad: {Proceedings of International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces}
%
% We CANNOT maintain strings for all possible proceedings. In case where no
% string is available, the following scheme should be used:
%
% PROC #{ Title of the Conference or Workshop (short name)}
%
% The title should NOT contain year, location, number of conference, etc., just the title!
% The short name should not contain a year!
%
% Good: PROC #{ ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)}
% Bad: {{CSCW} 2000, Proceeding on the {ACM} 2000 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, Philadelphia, PA, USA, December 2-6, 2000},
%
% There are also special proceedings where PROC cannot be used and a manual entry is necessary. In such cases
% we should follow "less is more"
%
% Good: {Adjunct Papers Proceedings of the International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp)}
% Bad: {UbiComp 2010: Ubiquitous Computing, 12th International Conference, UbiComp 2010, Copenhagen, Denmark, September 26-29, 2019, Adjunct Papers Proceedings}

abstract = {Network edge data attributes are usually encoded using color, opacity, stroke thickness and stroke pattern, or some combination thereof. In addition to these static variables, it is also possible to animate dynamic particles flowing along the edges. This opens a larger design space of animated edge textures, featuring additional visual encodings that have potential not only in terms of visual mapping capacity but also playfulness and aesthetics. Such animated edge textures have been used in several commercial and design-oriented visualizations, but to our knowledge almost always in a relatively ad hoc manner. We introduce a design space and Web-based framework for generating animated edge textures, and report on an initial evaluation of particle properties - particle speed, pattern and frequency - in terms of visual perception.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of labeling linear objects (such as streets) in interactive maps where the user can pan, zoom, and rotate continuously. Our labels contain text (such as street names). They are embedded into the objects they label, i.e., they follow the curvature of the objects, they do not move with respect to the map background, but they scale in order to maintain constant size on the screen. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that deals with curved labels in interactive maps.Our objective is to label as many streets as possible and to select label positions of high quality while forbidding labels to overlap at street crossings. We present a simple but effective algorithm that takes curvature and crossings into account and produces aesthetical labelings. On average over all interaction types, our implementation reaches interactive frame rates of more than 85 frames per second.},
